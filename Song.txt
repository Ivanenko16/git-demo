I remember when all the games began.
Remember every little lie
and every last goodbye.
Promises you broke, words you choked on
and I never walked away. Its still a mystery to me

Well I'm so empty
I'm better off without you and you're better off without me.
Well you're so UNCLEAN!!
I'm better off without you and YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME!!
